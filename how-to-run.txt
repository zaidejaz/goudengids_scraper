As i am using the linux so i am sending you this file on how to run the code. Because in linux everything is different. 

First of all install python 3.10 or higher
https://python.org/downloads

Then in you command prompt run this command (Note: You must be inside the scraper folder.)
pip install poetry

After it run this command
poetry install

and then
poetry shell

After successfully running this command all of you dependencies are downloaded.

Then you can run the scraper
python main.py

This will start the scraper. You must not stop the scraper until its complete otherwise you have to start over.


And if you want to get other data then you have to make changes in the code (main.py) file.

1. Find these lines inside the code.
# Base URLs
main_base_url = "https://www.goudengids.be/zoeken/tattoo/{}"
detail_base_url = "https://www.goudengids.be"

These are the base urls. Here it is zoken/tattoo. You should replace it to whatever you want to scraper.
You can just copy the user and add /{} at end of it.

detail_base_url will be same as the website is same.

For the pages as there are many of them i have manually set it.
As there were 68 pages of tatoos i have set the loop to 69. So in order to change it find these lines in main.py
            for page_num in range(1, 68):  # Pages from 1 to 68

            And replace the 68 with the number of pages you want to scrape.

And thats it. Also you may get blocked by the website after some requests. So this is also the issue.
